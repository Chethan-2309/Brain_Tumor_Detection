        <h2><i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i> About the Application</h2>
        <p>This tool leverages a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to provide a preliminary analysis of brain MRI scans. It is designed to classify an MRI as either containing a tumor or not. The system also includes a gatekeeper model to ensure that only valid MRI scans are processed, improving the reliability of the results. This project serves as a demonstration of how AI can be applied in the medical imaging field to assist in early detection.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> What is a Brain Tumor?</h2>
        <p>A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain. Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and both can cause serious health issues by pressing on sensitive areas of the brain. Early detection through imaging techniques like MRI is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment, significantly improving patient outcomes. Common symptoms can include headaches, seizures, and changes in personality or cognitive function.</p>
